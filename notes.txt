Configure some stuff for host.
	- Open C://xamp/apache/conf/extra/vhost.conf
        for virtual host entry, all we need is doc root and server name
        where doc root is the path for the main folder/public and server name
        is the desired url preferrably "link.me"
    - Run notepad as administrator and open C://windows/system32/drivers/etc/.host file
        add this lines:
            127.0.0.1 localhost
            127.0.0.1 link.me
    - Then restart apache

COMMANDS:
    composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel ProjectName
